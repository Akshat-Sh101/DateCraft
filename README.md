# DateCraft: Intelligent Date Formatter with Attention Mechanism

## Overview
DateCraft is a Python tool that extracts and standardizes dates from unstructured text or various date formats into `YYYY-MM-DD` using a transformer model with an attention mechanism. Unlike traditional regex-based date parsers, DateCraft leverages NLP to handle ambiguous, incomplete, or context-heavy date mentions, making it robust for real-world applications like document parsing or data cleaning.

## Features
- **Advanced Date Extraction**: Uses a transformer model with attention to identify date patterns in free text.
- **Format Standardization**: Converts detected dates to `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **Context Awareness**: Handles varied date expressions (e.g., "next Friday," "03/04/23," or "April 3rd, 2023").
- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable for other text parsing tasks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datecraft.git
   cd datecraft
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download pre-trained model weights (if provided) or train the model (see Training section).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `transformers`, `torch`, `numpy`, `pandas`
- See `requirements.txt` for full list.

## Usage
1. **Run the Date Formatter**:
   ```bash
   python datecraft.py --input "Meeting on April 3rd, 2023" --output_format "YYYY-MM-DD"
   ```
   Output: `2023-04-03`

2. **Batch Processing**:
   ```bash
   python datecraft.py --input_file input.txt --output_file dates.csv
   ```

3. **Example Input**:
   ```
   Next Friday, we met on 03/04/23, and plan for Dec 15 2025.
   ```
   Output: `["2025-10-24", "2023-04-03", "2025-12-15"]`

## Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: Custom transformer with attention layers for sequence tagging.
- **Input**: Tokenized text with contextual embeddings.
- **Output**: Detected date spans converted to `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Training Data**: Synthetic and real-world text with labeled date entities.

## Training
1. Prepare a dataset with text and corresponding date labels.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path dataset.csv --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
   ```
3. Model checkpoints are saved in `models/`.
